# odin-recipes
The Odin Project, foundation course, Project: Recipes

This is my solution to the first assignment of the Odin Project.
The aim of this assignment was to practice basic HTML.
The assigment was to make a small recipe website.

The website contains a index page linking to all the recipes.
3 recipe pages, each containing a image file, a link to the main index page, a small paragraph describing the recipe, a list of ingrediÃ«nts, and step-by-step instruction for making the recipe.

During this project I learned/practiced to use these different HTML elements:

Headers (h1 and h2)
paragraph elements
achor elements (links)
image elements
ordered lists
unordered lists
emphasis elements

The images used in the project where all created with Google Gemini.

The secondary goals of the project are to practice basic git operations and publishing a project using Github. To learn basic project file structure and learning to write good commit messages.
